                                        <p>The pandemic forced companies to shift into the remote working realm. PhoneIQ saw a massive increase in the number of companies that now needed its world-leading communication platform. </p>

                                <p>In particular, PhoneIQ understood that writing in the technology sector required writers to be <a href="#">"very focused on checking for updated sources and trends.‚Äù</a> In addition, they knew that the writers would need excellent research skills to deliver the type of content they desired.</p>
                                <p>To start with, their marketing team managed all of the content in-house. PhoneIQ had team members write the articles required and then moved to hire an independent <a href="#">tech content writing service </a>to help as guest writers.</p>
