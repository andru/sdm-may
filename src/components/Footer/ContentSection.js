                                    <p>SEO web content writing is the art of producing high-end content for website visitors while, at the same time, adhering to the best SEO practices. Doing so ensures that the content is easy to find and drives qualified leads to your webpage from search engines.  </p>
                                    <p>Search engines feature complex algorithms to separate valuable content from web copy that uses outdated SEO practices. For example, inserting keywords into bad-quality, shallow content won't improve a website's ranking. Cooperating with expert writers is the safest choice.</p>
                                    <p>Every Strategically writer is trained in the latest SEO practices and knows how to use high-end marketing techniques and craft informative, engaging, and actionable copy.</p>
                                    <p>We combine journalism with creative writing and SEO marketing to produce content for our clients. Consequently, regardless of the type of ordered content, from white papers to blog posts, we ensure our copy hits the mark every time.</p>
                                    <p>Hiring an SEO content writer or service can be an excellent investment to improve your online visibility and attract more traffic to your website. By outsourcing your content needs, you can focus on other aspects of your business, such as marketing and customer service, while ensuring that your website receives the attention it deserves.</p>

                                    <p>Search engine optimisation (SEO) is a long-term marketing strategy. It improves the visibility and organic search results of a website or landing page in Google and other global search engines.</p>
                                    <p>Proper SEO techniques can drive more traffic to a site from organic or unpaid search results than paid advertisements.</p>
                                    <p>Not everyone understands how to do SEO from the get-go. This is why people turn to professional SEO writing solutions, such as Strategically, to scale their SEO content.</p>
                                    <p>Here are some handy SEO writing tips and techniques:</p>
                                    <h5>Research your keywords</h5>
                                    <p>Before you start writing, it's essential to do your research and figure out which keywords you want to target. You can use various tools, such as Google's Keyword Planner (free) and many other paid tools, to find high-traffic, relevant keywords. Once you have a list of potential keywords, it's time to start writing!</p>
                                    <h5>Write for your audience</h5>
                                    <p>Before creating content, you need to know your target audience. It seems straightforward, yet many businesses produce content for the wrong reasons.</p>
                                    <p>Not every post should be about your products or services. The aim should be to create industry-related content and offer real value to readers.</p>
                                    <p>In other words, establish yourself and your company as an expert within your industry.</p>
                                    <h5>Keep everything under one roof</h5>
                                    <p>Get the traffic your website deserves by maintaining your content under your domain name. </p>
                                    <h5>Use keywords</h5>
                                    <p>Using relevant keyword-rich phrases in headlines and throughout your content allows readers and search engines to know what your topic is about. </p>
                                    <p>As such, use keywords sparingly and thoughtfully and stick to a natural feel. But take care. Visitors won't like it if you stuff too many keywords, and Google will penalise you.</p>
                                    <h5>Create attractive headlines</h5>
                                    <p>Engaging headlines that appeal to readers ensures they're going to click on your post. Don't underestimate the power and effectiveness of a headline in SEO. </p>
                                    <p>Write headlines that are short, clear, eye-catching, and rich in keywords. Also, add meta descriptions to further elaborate on your topic. </p>
                                    <h5>Optimise the meta title and description</h5>
                                    <p>The meta tags appear in the search results, so it's important to ensure they are optimised for your target keywords. For your title, aim for something that is both catchy and includes your target keywords. </p>
                                    <p>The meta description should be a gist of your article that appears in the search results. Again, aim for something informative that includes your target keywords.</p>
                                    <h5>Add images</h5>
                                    <p>Adding an image to your blog content makes a great impression on people, as humans love visual content. Use royalty-free images for obvious reasons, or take a premium subscription from a stock photo provider subscription if you have the budget. </p>
                                    <p>It's also essential to optimise your images for the web. It means adding alt text to them—which is a short description of the image that appears when the image is loading or if the image can't be displayed.</p>
                                    <h5>Structure your content</h5>
                                    <p>If the contents of your blog post aren't organised, they'll get lost. To avoid this, break your content into smaller paragraphs with clear headlines to keep readers engaged and your content easy to read. </p>
                                    <p>Use the correct tag hierarchy when tagging headlines, such as H1 for titles or H2 for subsections. In summary, proper back-end organisation is paramount to a website's success.</p>
                                    <h5>Make sure your website is well-structured</h5>
                                    <p>Search engines like websites that are well-organised and easy to navigate. Make sure your website has a clear hierarchy and well-defined navigation. Use descriptive titles and URLs that accurately reflect the content on each page.</p>
                                    <h5>Link building</h5>
                                    <p>This SEO technique has come a long way since the practice of link buying. That said, links are still a crucial ranking factor for SEO. Aim to link to your previously published articles in your recent posts to ensure a link back to your website if another webpage picks your content. This increases your website's authority, helping it rank higher on Google.</p>
                                    <h5>Promote your content</h5>
                                    <p>Once your article is published, promote it to get the word out. You can do this through social media, email marketing, and other marketing channels. </p>
                                    <p>The more people see and share your article, the more likely it is to rank well in the search results.</p>
                                    <h5>Monitor your efforts</h5>
                                    <p>Lastly, staying on top of your SEO content by utilising Google Analytics (or other similar tools) is vital for understanding how your content is doing.</p>
                                    <p>Checking page views, bounce rate, and the average time a viewer spends on a page helps you determine whether your content strategy is successful.</p>
                                    <p>SEO is a complex process, but following these steps will help you get started on the right foot.</p>

                                    <p>The cost depends on your relationship with the writer and the writer's content creation experience. In most cases, freelance writers charge an hourly or per-project fee. In both scenarios, it can be a real challenge to budget your SEO article writing ahead of time. Plus, if you need revisions, there's no guarantee that a freelance article writer won't charge extra.</p>
                                    <p>As an agency, we have a rule: we always charge upfront and never add surprise costs or hidden fees. We keep it simple by charging only per word for our copy. When you place an order through our order management system, you decide the number of words, so you already know how long your article will be and how much it will cost.</p>
                                    <p>Additionally, we offer FREE revisions. Yep, that's right. FREE revisions. This way, we ensure our clients are 100% satisfied with our content.</p>

                                    <p>Writing a research article is more challenging than blog writing or creating a traditional landing page. Why? It's because a research article requires in-depth research from the writer's side.</p>
                                    <p>For starters, you need to identify the research question or study objective. Why? Because it's the central organising principle of the paper. Without it, there's no research article. The key attributes to a good research question are:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p>Specificity</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Novelty</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Relevance to the scientific community or to what the type of content the client's asking for</p></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>With this in mind, the structure of the paper comes next. The elemental composition of a typical research article is the following sequence:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p><strong>Introduction:</strong> This is where you will introduce your topic and explain why it is important. Be sure to include a hypothesis, as this will help to guide your research.</p></li>
                                        <li><p><strong>Methods:</strong> In this step, you will describe the methods you used to conduct your research. Include details on your participants, data collection, and data analysis.</p></li>
                                        <li><p><strong>Results:</strong> Now, it's time to present your findings. Include both quantitative and qualitative data.</p></li>
                                        <li><p><strong>Discussion:</strong> The last step should discuss the implications of your findings, explaining what the results mean and how they relate to the topic.</p></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>We're a content writing agency, not an academic institution. Yet, our team of writers is experienced in producing such content for an everyday audience. We still adhere to research principles and cite studies and scientific results to support our claims as we expand on our client's topic but do it in a way that will be understandable by all and in a voice that matches the client's style.</p>
                                    <p>Give us a phone call or email to discuss your research article needs. We'd be more than happy to pitch in and help out!</p>

                                    <h4 className="mb-7">What are content writing and article writing?</h4>
                                    <p>Content writing and article writing are often used interchangeably, but the terms don't refer to the same thing.</p>
                                    <p>Article writing consists of writing only articles, while content writing is a whole industry and involves numerous forms of content — web copy, product reviews, product descriptions, blogs, SEO pieces, news pieces, creative writing, advertorials, press releases, and so on.</p>
                                    <p>Content writing aims to achieve better traction, reach more prospects, and provide value to website visitors. Content writing can market a business idea effectively to the target audience. In contrast, article writing typically doesn't have an objective and aims to inform readers about a product, service or event.</p>
                                    <p>Content writing is used to promote a product, service, or brand. It's meant to engage the reader and persuade them to take action. The writing style is to the point, as it needs to hold the readers' attention.</p>
                                    <p>On the other hand, article writing is used to inform or educate the reader on a particular topic. Articles are usually longer than content pieces, as they go into greater detail on the subject. It's often found in magazines, personal blogs, educational platforms, or newspapers, as the goal is to inform the reader about something.</p>
                                    <p>Article writing tends to have a formal approach with a predefined format, while content writing isn't that strict. For instance, when creating advertorials, you don't have to follow a specific structure unless the client asks for one.</p>
                                    <p>Lastly, content writing doesn't have a particular target audience or may target people with different interests. Article writing, though, is specific and dedicated to a particular audience.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p>Content writing is more informal, shorter, engaging, and includes calls to action</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Article writing is more formal, longer, and focused on providing information</p></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>In every case, our agency is highly experienced in content and article writing, so don't hesitate to contact us for your content needs!</p>
